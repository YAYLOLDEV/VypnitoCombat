A comprehensive combat management plugin designed to provide server owners with full control over PvP interactions, combat logging, and server safety.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Combat Tagging:** Puts players in combat mode upon attacking, preventing them from using disallowed commands or items.
- **Persistent Cooldowns:** Post-combat cooldowns for items like Elytras are saved to a database (SQLite) and persist through server restarts.
- **Global PvP Toggle:** Enable or disable PvP across the entire server with a simple command (`/pvp global <on|off>`).
- **Indirect PvP Protection:** When global PvP is off, players are protected from:
    - Lava placement near other players.
    - Harmful splash potions.
- **WorldGuard Integration:** Prevent players from entering "safe regions" (e.g., `pvp: deny` or `invincible: allow`) while in combat. Players are gently "bounced" back.
- **In-Combat Restrictions:**
    - Block specific commands (e.g., `/home`, `/spawn`).
    - Block specific items (e.g., Elytra).
    - Block usage of Riptide Tridents.
- **Admin Tools:** A full suite of commands for staff to manage the combat state of players (`/vc status`, `/vc tag`, `/vc untag`).
- **Customizable Punishments:** Configure what happens when a player combat logs - kill them, execute custom commands, or both.
- **PlaceholderAPI Support:** Placeholders to show a player's combat status in other plugins.
- **Highly Configurable:** Almost every feature, message, and timer can be configured via `config.yml` and `messages.yml`.
